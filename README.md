## Fron-Trivia

### What is Fron-triva?

Fron-trivia is a trivia game based on questions in the following categories
* html 
* css 
* javascript. 

### The purpose

>The purpose of this game is to allow those starting the daunting path of programming, to test their knowlege in these earlier mentioned areas.

###
Originally the **goal** plan was to be able to pick a topic and answer some questions based off that topic, but that's still in the works and I will get it there. For now it is a one player game that askes you questions about **HTML** **CSS** and **JAVASCRIPT**. The game is able to keep track of your score and lets you know if you won, lost, answered correctly or incorrectly. In the future I want this game to be a two player game with the abilty to use a high score board that will hold the first players score even if the page is reloaded or the game is reset.
### Programming languages used

This web application game is built using html, css, and javascript and some jquery for the confetti. I used an arrays of objects to store the games' questions and answers and I also used DOM munipulation to make things happen real time.
